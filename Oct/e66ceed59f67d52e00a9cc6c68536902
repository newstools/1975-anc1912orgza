We enclose herewith a copy of a document published by our Information Department exposing the dangerous and sinister policy of the Government of the Federal Republic of Germany aimed at perpetuating the South African apartheid regime.Your Excellency will agree that the facts contained in this document clearly show that the collaboration between the Federal Republic and racist South Africa constitutes a serious threat to independent Africa and indeed to world peace.We shall be extremely grateful if Your Excellency will use his good offices to inform Member States at the United Nations of the contents of this document and call on them to express their most vigorous protest to the Government of the Federal Republic and call on it to desist from continuing its collaboration with the apartheid regime.We also enclose some photocopies of British press reports on our document which may be of interest to Your Excellency. A digest of the West German press on this subject is being translated and we shall be pleased to send Your Excellency a copy immediately it is printed.(Signed) O.R. TamboPresident
